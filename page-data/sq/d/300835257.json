Following the success of last year's initiative, we’re continuing our commitment to support developers who significantly contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. This year, the program continues to offer financial awards and recognition to developers within the Kotlin community who maintain active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. Importantly, we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we assist, believing that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nTo be considered, submitted projects need to fulfill the following criteria:\n\nOpen-Source License — Projects must be available under a permissive open-source license to ensure they remain accessible to everyone and contribute positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Active Maintenance — Projects should be actively maintained with a consistent development history and contributions.\n\nSubmit your grant proposals before June 25, 2024. The Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will evaluate submissions based on their potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices, and responsiveness to bug reports and security concerns.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like further information related to the program, please contact us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or join the discussion in the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel. We look forward to seeing your innovative contributions and supporting your efforts to advance the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem!\n\nTo see the winning projects from last year, check out our previous announcement.","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-continues-in-2024/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2024","title":"The Kotlin Foundation Grants Program Continues in 2024","spoilerSize":255}},{"id":"81c51704-dd2f-5298-8367-969d7b2c4afb","excerpt":"The Kotlin Foundation recently hosted the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest for the second year in a row, inviting students and recent graduates to showcase their skills. Participants created applications for Android, iOS, desktop, web, and server, showcasing the versatility of Kotlin Multiplatform. We received submissions from around the world, and a panel of judges selected three winners. The winners won a trip to KotlinConf’24 in Copenhagen, including tickets, travel, accommodation, and Kotlin swag. All qualifying participants also got some Kotlin souvenirs.\n\nMeet the winners:\n\nPatrycja Bachleda, from the Florida Institute of Technology, USA, is the author of College Advisor. College Advisor provides financial insights about universities and majors, aiding students in making financially savvy decisions. The judges applauded the use of Compose Multiplatform in the project.\n\nSamson Aricha Momanyi, from the Technical University of Mombasa, Kenya, is the author of Organiks. Organiks is a digitizing tool for the agricultural sector in Africa. The project is built for Android and desktop using Ktor for server and Gemini AI. The judges commended the usage of Ktor for server-side, highlighted the compelling storytelling aspect, and appreciated the offline-first approach.\n\nCaleb Asira Etemesi, from Strathmore University, Kenya, is the author of Pixly. Pixly is an image editor built using Compose Multiplatform that works on Windows, Linux, and Android devices. The judges recognized the project's creativity and uniqueness in employing a Rust library as a backend.\n\nCongratulations to Patrycja, Samson, and Caleb! Your mastery of Kotlin Multiplatform has made a significant impact. As we look forward to KotlinConf’24, let's continue exploring and shaping the Kotlin landscape!","fields":{"slug":"/news/kotlin-multiplatform-contest-winners-spotlight/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 14, 2024","title":"Kotlin Multiplatform Contest Winners Spotlight","spoilerSize":582}}]}}}
