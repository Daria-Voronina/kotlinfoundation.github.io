The Ecosystem Committee will play a pivotal role in identifying strategic areas for investment in the Kotlin ecosystem. It will prioritize and recommend direct funding of open-source Kotlin projects and raise awareness of members’ individual efforts in developing and enhancing key libraries.\n\nThe Ecosystem Committee has already contributed to the Foundation’s work by designing and launching the new Grants Program, which supports authors of open-source libraries, tools, and frameworks. As the program supervisor, the committee will review grant applications, evaluate submitted projects, and decide whether each project meets the specific criteria for receiving the grant.\n\nThe new committee will serve as the research arm of the Kotlin Foundation board, assisting in maintaining the Kotlin ecosystem’s growth and sustainability. We are confident it will bring a fresh perspective and help us make informed decisions that will benefit the entire ecosystem.\n\nWe are excited to see the positive impact the Committee’s efforts will have on the Kotlin ecosystem in the near future.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Kotlin Foundation and its work, feel free to get in touch with us in the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel or via email at hello@kotlinfoundation.org.","fields":{"slug":"/news/new-ecosystem-committee/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 25, 2023","title":"The Kotlin Foundation Establishes the New Ecosystem Committee","spoilerSize":450}},{"id":"122824ae-b9ae-579e-a905-3911d5c44af4","excerpt":"Today, we’re introducing the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program! This initiative will be held on a regular basis and provide financial awards to developers who contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. At the Kotlin Foundation, we understand the effort that goes into maintaining active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. We want to support these contributors, acknowledge their hard work, and encourage them to invest more time and energy into their projects and continue to make a difference. One of the program's essential aspects is that we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support. We believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nThe Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will oversee the Grants Program. To be considered, projects must meet several requirements. First, the project must be available under a permissive open-source license. This ensures that the project remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Second, the project must be actively maintained and have a track record of development history and contributions. Finally, the project should be developed by private individuals. This means contributors are not allowed to develop their projects as part of their usual line of work.\n\nWe encourage you to submit your grant proposals before May 15, 2023. The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate projects based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices for library development, and responsiveness to bug reports and security issues.\n\nPlease reach out to us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or through the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel, where we'd be more than happy to address any of your program-related questions or concerns. We hope that the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program will provide contributors with the necessary support to continue their work, and we look forward to how you can shape the future of the Kotlin Multiplatform!","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-goes-live/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2023","title":"The Kotlin Foundation grants program is live","spoilerSize":500}}]}}}
