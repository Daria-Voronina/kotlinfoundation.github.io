Following the success of last year's initiative, we’re continuing our commitment to support developers who significantly contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. This year, the program continues to offer financial awards and recognition to developers within the Kotlin community who maintain active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. Importantly, we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we assist, believing that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nTo be considered, submitted projects need to fulfill the following criteria:\n\nOpen-Source License — Projects must be available under a permissive open-source license to ensure they remain accessible to everyone and contribute positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Active Maintenance — Projects should be actively maintained with a consistent development history and contributions.\n\nSubmit your grant proposals before June 25, 2024. The Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will evaluate submissions based on their potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices, and responsiveness to bug reports and security concerns.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like further information related to the program, please contact us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or join the discussion in the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel. We look forward to seeing your innovative contributions and supporting your efforts to advance the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem!\n\nTo see the winning projects from last year, check out our previous announcement.","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-continues-in-2024/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2024","title":"The Kotlin Foundation Grants Program Continues in 2024","spoilerSize":255}},{"id":"98c182f8-b5a0-52a2-beb6-0fc3f952b814","excerpt":"We’re delighted to share that Uber has joined the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver Member. With another industry leader on board, we have even greater opportunities to support and advance Kotlin. Uber's commitment to Kotlin is evident in its extensive codebase. Besides embracing Kotlin, Uber is also actively contributing to the Kotlin ecosystem. This includes developing integrations for Kotlin with build systems like Buck, Bazel, and Gradle. Uber has also contributed to Detekt's development and initiated the creation of its compiler plugin version.\n\nFurthermore, they helped establish the enterprise Java-to-Kotlin working group, a collaborative effort involving Meta, Google, JetBrains, and Uber themselves. The group's main goal is to provide companies with the tooling and expertise needed to migrate large legacy Java codebases to Kotlin and to encourage contributions to these tools.\n\nAs a Silver Member, Uber will play a crucial role in supporting the Foundation's initiatives, like the Grants program for open-source library authors and the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest for students. Their expertise will be invaluable in advancing the Kotlin ecosystem, and we are excited to collaborate with them on future projects.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and our initiatives, please visit the Membership page. Join us and shape the future of the Kotlin ecosystem!","fields":{"slug":"/news/uber-becomes-kotlin-foundation-silver-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2024","title":"Uber Becomes Kotlin Foundation Silver Member","spoilerSize":260}}]}}}
