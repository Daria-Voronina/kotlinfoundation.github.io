Gradle, a Kotlin Foundation member, provided mentoring support for this project, and we'd like to share details about the project. The contributor to this project was Nikolai Vladimirov, a third-year student from Constructor University, and the mentor was Donát Csikós, a Senior Software Engineer at Gradle. The project aimed to bring support for Gradle Kotlin Scripts (.kts) to the Eclipse IDE.\n\nThe initial goal was to improve user interaction with Gradle Kotlin scripts inside the Eclipse IDE. The goal was to implement the following functionality:\n\nSyntax highlighting for Kotlin scripts Content assistance Go-to-definition Accurate diagnostics for syntax errors Signature help Hovering\n\nNikolai successfully delivered these features by implementing support for Kotlin scripts based on the existing kotlin-language-server project, creating a new system to separate compilation environments for each build script. Here are examples of each feature:\n\nSyntax highlighting for .kts scripts\n\nContent assistance\n\nGo-to-definition\n\nAccurate Diagnostics for syntax errors\n\nSignature help\n\nHovering\n\nInstallation\n\nThe new features are not yet production-ready, and it currently does not work on Windows. Consequently, they are delivered as optional installables. You can find them in the latest update sites under the Buildship Extras - Incubating category.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf you'd like to get involved with improving the Eclipse Kotlin Gradle Script support, there are two parts:\n\nEclipse plugin: The plugin is part of the Buildship project. The implementation is in the org.eclipse.buildship.kotlindsl.provider subproject. Language server: The IDE-agnostic components are implemented in this repository in the GSoC-work branch.\n\nThe remaining tasks are to add a couple of minor features and incrementally improve the reliability, stability, and performance of this plugin.\n\nWe are grateful for Nikolai and Donát's contributions to making Kotlin better for developers!","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2023-eclipse-gradle-kotlin/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"December 18, 2023","title":"Google Summer of Code 2023 – Eclipse Gradle Kotlin Script Support","spoilerSize":null}},{"id":"72da5ba2-df88-57d6-86a1-c0f205dc0d6f","excerpt":"Dear Kotlin Community, We would like to announce recent changes in the Kotlin Foundation:\n\nNew Lead Language Designer\n\nMikhail Zarechenskii has been voted in unanimously as the Lead Language Designer by the Founding members of the Foundation.
