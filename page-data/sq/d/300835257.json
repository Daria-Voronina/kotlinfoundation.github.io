This new partnership will advance the ecosystem and enrich the Kotlin community. The Kotzilla team has put significant effort into the advancement of Kotlin, especially with the creation of Koin, an open-source dependency injection (DI) framework. Koin helps developers manage their dependencies efficiently, write clean and modular code, as well as develop scalable and maintainable applications. Known for its simplicity and effectiveness, Koin is fully compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform, enhancing the development of seamless and efficient mobile apps. Currently, Koin is used in over 350,000 mobile applications worldwide and has more than 9 million downloads each month, highlighting its essential role in the Kotlin ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Kotzilla team is developing other tools like Cloud-Inject that further support the community in creating safer, faster, and more scalable applications.\n\n“Our partnership with the Kotlin Foundation will further propel our mission to make developers' lives easier,” says Arnaud Giuliani, Koin Framework Creator and Lead at Kotzilla.\n\nAs a member of the Kotlin Foundation, Kotzilla will significantly contribute to the Foundation's initiatives, including the grants program for open-source library authors.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and how members like Kotzilla are contributing to and benefiting from its mission, please visit the membership page. Join us in shaping the future of the Kotlin ecosystem!","fields":{"slug":"/news/kotzilla-joins-kotlin-foundation-silver-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 06, 2024","title":"Kotzilla Joins the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver Member","spoilerSize":90}},{"id":"653ee184-b590-5f74-baa9-2da4e50534ad","excerpt":"We are pleased to announce the launch of the second round of the Kotlin Foundation Grants Program. Following the success of last year's initiative, we’re continuing our commitment to support developers who significantly contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. This year, the program continues to offer financial awards and recognition to developers within the Kotlin community who maintain active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. Importantly, we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we assist, believing that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nTo be considered, submitted projects need to fulfill the following criteria:\n\nOpen-Source License — Projects must be available under a permissive open-source license to ensure they remain accessible to everyone and contribute positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Active Maintenance — Projects should be actively maintained with a consistent development history and contributions.\n\nSubmit your grant proposals before June 25, 2024. The Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will evaluate submissions based on their potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices, and responsiveness to bug reports and security concerns.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like further information related to the program, please contact us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or join the discussion in the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel. We look forward to seeing your innovative contributions and supporting your efforts to advance the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem!\n\nTo see the winning projects from last year, check out our previous announcement.","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-continues-in-2024/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2024","title":"The Kotlin Foundation Grants Program Continues in 2024","spoilerSize":255}}]}}}
