This initiative will be held on a regular basis and provide financial awards to developers who contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. At the Kotlin Foundation, we understand the effort that goes into maintaining active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. We want to support these contributors, acknowledge their hard work, and encourage them to invest more time and energy into their projects and continue to make a difference. One of the program's essential aspects is that we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support. We believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nThe Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will oversee the Grants Program. To be considered, projects must meet several requirements. First, the project must be available under a permissive open-source license. This ensures that the project remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Second, the project must be actively maintained and have a track record of development history and contributions. Finally, the project should be developed by private individuals. This means contributors are not allowed to develop their projects as part of their usual line of work.\n\nWe encourage you to submit your grant proposals before May 15, 2023. The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate projects based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices for library development, and responsiveness to bug reports and security issues.\n\nPlease reach out to us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or through the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel, where we'd be more than happy to address any of your program-related questions or concerns. We hope that the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program will provide contributors with the necessary support to continue their work, and we look forward to how you can shape the future of the Kotlin Multiplatform!","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-goes-live/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2023","title":"The Kotlin Foundation grants program is live","spoilerSize":499,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/6d80e70d11e665f464fd042170f59419/cover.jpg"}}},{"id":"dcc08480-bf0d-5f92-9cb3-07d3eab0aa22","excerpt":"We are thrilled to announce that Gradle Inc., Touchlab, and Shopify have recently joined the Kotlin Foundation as its first silver members. These companies bring with them a wealth of knowledge and experience on how Kotlin is used in production and what the Kotlin ecosystem needs. We are excited to have their collective experience join us in supporting and advancing the Kotlin ecosystem. Gradle Inc. is the creator of the most widely used build tool for Kotlin and the default build system for Android, Kotlin/Native, and Kotlin Multiplatform, called Gradle Build Tool. The company also provides the leading software solution for improving developer productivity and happiness called Gradle Enterprise and is pioneering the emerging practice of Developer Productivity Engineering. As a silver member of the Kotlin Foundation, Gradle will help advance the development of the Kotlin ecosystem and promote the use of Kotlin as a tool for education and industry.\n\n“At Gradle, we are dedicated to providing a productivity platform across all build and language ecosystems,” said Hans Dockter, co-founder and CEO of Gradle. “Gradle has been a longtime supporter of the Kotlin community and we’re excited to further our relationship as a member of the Kotlin Foundation.”\n\nTouchlab is a Kotlin Multiplatform solutions company, and as early members of the community began publishing core open-source libraries and advocating for KMP immediately after its announcement. In 2018 Touchlab began providing tools and technology that organizations need to get KMP in production. They directly publish or contribute to a number of critical KMP libraries, have contributed directly to the Kotlin language and ecosystem, and have consulted many organizations adopting the technology. As silver members of the Kotlin foundation, Touchlab will continue to support the developers championing the language and help teams add KMP to production.\n\n\"Today’s Kotlin story across server, mobile, and web, is singularly powerful. Tomorrow’s Kotlin story: with Web Assembly, portable UI’s, a vibrant ecosystem, and much more, is not just great for the platform. Kotlin will help shape the future of technology. We at Touchlab are extremely proud and excited to help define that future.\" said Kevin Galligan, Technical Partner of Touchlab.\n\nShopify is a global commerce platform that powers millions of businesses in over 170 countries. The company is an early adopter of Kotlin and uses Kotlin Multiplatform at scale for features that have high performance requirements.\n\n\"Kotlin Multiplatform is a key part of the mobile tech stack at Shopify. We’re thrilled to help shape its future and further increase our support of the Kotlin ecosystem by joining the Kotlin Foundation.\" - Mustafa Ali, Head of Core Mobile Engineering, Shopify.\n\nBeing part of the Kotlin Foundation gives Gradle, Touchlab, and Shopify the opportunity to support various initiatives, including the Grants program for open-source library authors and the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest for students. The Grants program supports open-source library authors in the Kotlin community, while the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest encourages students to use Kotlin Multiplatform to develop their apps. By supporting these initiatives, our new members can help us accelerate the development of the Kotlin ecosystem and promote the use of Kotlin as a tool for education and industry.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Kotlin Foundation or our initiatives, please visit the Membership page.

But as of 2023, the Foundation is taking on more responsibility, which includes advancing the Kotlin ecosystem and promoting Kotlin in education. At the Kotlin Foundation, we believe many companies that rely on the Kotlin ecosystem want to give back to the community and help the Foundation fulfill its mission. That’s why we are pleased to announce the Kotlin Foundation Membership Program for companies and organizations. The program allows you to become a part of Kotlin’s history and influence its ecosystem by contributing your work and ideas.\n\nAs a Kotlin Foundation member, you’ll support the Kotlin ecosystem by sponsoring projects that are important to the Kotlin community. Foundation members contribute to the board, committees, and workgroups helping shape the Foundation's funding distribution and overall strategy. Moreover, it’s an excellent opportunity to build a brand connection between the Kotlin community and your company.\n\nThe program offers different tiers to distinguish your business, so you can pick the one that works best for you and your needs: Gold or Silver.\n\nGold membership is the perfect choice for companies and organizations looking to become active contributors to the Foundation's work, safeguarding the Foundation's financial and operational strength. Gold tier benefits include a guaranteed seat on the Foundation Board of Directors and the right to serve as Board Secretary.\n\nSilver membership is designed for businesses and organizations that wish to get their name out there as big contributors to the Foundation. Silver members gain an opportunity to sit on the Foundation's board. For every 5 Silver members, you'll get 1 seat on the board. You’ll also be able to take part in the Operating, Trademark, and Ecosystem Committees.\n\nJoin other Foundation members to help us shape and develop the Kotlin ecosystem.
