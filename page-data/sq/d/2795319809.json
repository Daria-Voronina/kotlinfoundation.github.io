The contributor to this project was Giancarlo Buenaflor, a computer science undergraduate, and the mentor was Mark Mann, a Kotlin Multiplatform engineer at Google. Introduction\n\nFlogger, Google's default logging framework for JVM projects, opens up new opportunities for efficient cross-platform logging. The KFlogger project aims to enable the integration of Flogger into iOS and JVM, benefitting from the multiplatform capabilities of Kotlin.\n\nKFlogger incorporates the existing JVM Flogger codebase as a Java module, preserving its core functionality. The JVM implementation remains largely untouched and is directly actualized through the actual typealias mechanism. On the iOS side, KFlogger introduces a default logging backend based on OSLog.\n\nHere is a demo of this working on Android and iOS:\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo use KFlogger, add the following dependency to your commonMain sourceSet:\n\n// Find the latest version \n// on https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.giancarlobuenaflor/kflogger\nimplementation(\"com.buenaflor:kflogger:0.0.3\")\n\n\nThis will allow you to start simple logging. Add the KFluentLogger instance to your class and then you can start logging through your common code:\n\nimport com.giancarlobuenaflor.kflogger.KFluentLogger\n\nclass LoggingClass {\n    private val logger = KFluentLogger.forEnclosingClass()\n    \n    fun log() {\n        logger.atWarning().log(\"string: %s\", \"example\")\n        logger.atWarning().log(\"integer: %d:\", 1)\n        logger.atWarning().log(\"float: %f\", 1.0f)\n        logger.atWarning().log(\"%d%% %s\", 100, \"chance\")\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe source is in a GitHub repository and we'd love your feedback and contributions!\n\nThank you Giancarlo and Mark for helping make Kotlin Multiplatform even better!","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2023-kflogger/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 08, 2024","title":"Google Summer of Code 2023 - KFlogger (Kotlin Multiplatform Flogger)","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":null}},{"id":"35934900-85cb-523f-b9dd-f5f8a1ee9b2b","excerpt":"The Kotlin Foundation sponsored 4 projects for the Google Summer of Code 2023, and we are excited to announce the completion of the Eclipse Gradle Kotlin Script Support project! Gradle, a Kotlin Foundation member, provided mentoring support for this project, and we'd like to share details about the project. The contributor to this project was Nikolai Vladimirov, a third-year student from Constructor University, and the mentor was Donát Csikós, a Senior Software Engineer at Gradle. The project aimed to bring support for Gradle Kotlin Scripts (.kts) to the Eclipse IDE.\n\nThe initial goal was to improve user interaction with Gradle Kotlin scripts inside the Eclipse IDE. The goal was to implement the following functionality:\n\nSyntax highlighting for Kotlin scripts Content assistance Go-to-definition Accurate diagnostics for syntax errors Signature help Hovering\n\nNikolai successfully delivered these features by implementing support for Kotlin scripts based on the existing kotlin-language-server project, creating a new system to separate compilation environments for each build script. Here are examples of each feature:\n\nSyntax highlighting for .kts scripts\n\nContent assistance\n\nGo-to-definition\n\nAccurate Diagnostics for syntax errors\n\nSignature help\n\nHovering\n\nInstallation\n\nThe new features are not yet production-ready, and it currently does not work on Windows. Consequently, they are delivered as optional installables. You can find them in the latest update sites under the Buildship Extras - Incubating category.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf you'd like to get involved with improving the Eclipse Kotlin Gradle Script support, there are two parts:\n\nEclipse plugin: The plugin is part of the Buildship project. The implementation is in the org.eclipse.buildship.kotlindsl.provider subproject. Language server: The IDE-agnostic components are implemented in this repository in the GSoC-work branch.\n\nThe remaining tasks are to add a couple of minor features and incrementally improve the reliability, stability, and performance of this plugin.\n\nWe are grateful for Nikolai and Donát's contributions to making Kotlin better for developers!","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2023-eclipse-gradle-kotlin/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 05, 2024","title":"Google Summer of Code 2023 – Eclipse Gradle Kotlin Script Support","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":null}},{"id":"72da5ba2-df88-57d6-86a1-c0f205dc0d6f","excerpt":"Dear Kotlin Community, We would like to announce recent changes in the Kotlin Foundation:\n\nNew Lead Language Designer\n\nMikhail Zarechenskii has been voted in unanimously as the Lead Language Designer by the Founding members of the Foundation.

The program attracted many talented authors of projects from different areas of the Kotlin ecosystem, resulting in a total of 109 applications! After a meticulous review process, we are proud to unveil the five lucky winners:\n\nCoil – an image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin coroutines. The proposal: Implement Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform support and improve features such as network request pooling and caching animated images. Store – a Kotlin Multiplatform library for building network-resilient applications. The proposal: Enhance Store5 with MutableStore, fallback mechanisms, memory cache delegation, and expand its reach beyond Android. Http4k – a functional toolkit for Kotlin HTTP applications. The proposal: Modularize the library to make it even more lightweight at its core and find the best way to provide multiplatform support. KMP-NativeCoroutines – a library to use Kotlin coroutines from Swift code in KMP apps. The proposal: Make the library API stable. Lyricist – an internationalization and localization multiplatform library for Compose. The proposal: Decouple the library from Compose, making it possible to use it on any multiplatform project.\n\nThese open-source projects stood out to the Ecosystem Committee on account of their quality, proposals, and alignment with our criteria.\n\nEach grant recipient will receive $6,000 to further develop and expand their projects.\n\nWe encourage all applicants who did not receive a grant this time to continue developing their projects and watch out for future opportunities.

This initiative will be held on a regular basis and provide financial awards to developers who contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. At the Kotlin Foundation, we understand the effort that goes into maintaining active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. We want to support these contributors, acknowledge their hard work, and encourage them to invest more time and energy into their projects and continue to make a difference. One of the program's essential aspects is that we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support. We believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nThe Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will oversee the Grants Program. To be considered, projects must meet several requirements. First, the project must be available under a permissive open-source license. This ensures that the project remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Second, the project must be actively maintained and have a track record of development history and contributions. Finally, the project should be developed by private individuals. This means contributors are not allowed to develop their projects as part of their usual line of work.\n\nWe encourage you to submit your grant proposals before May 15, 2023. The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate projects based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices for library development, and responsiveness to bug reports and security issues.\n\nPlease reach out to us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or through the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel, where we'd be more than happy to address any of your program-related questions or concerns.
