The following guidelines provide guidance on how to reference the Kotlin word trademark (“Trademark”) in an approved manner while ensuring the Trademark remains subject to protection under applicable laws around the world, and continues to serve as a source indicator for the Kotlin programming language and related offerings.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Any use of the Trademark other than those described in these Guidelines must be approved in advance. Please contact\nthe Kotlin Foundation to request an express trademark license if you desire to use the Kotlin trademark, or a\nderivative of the Kotlin trademark, in a manner not permitted under these Guidelines.

For\nexample \"Kotlin™ ...\" This requirement is waived in all contexts where such marks are not normally included, such as non-marketing emails, online discussions, and academic papers.

However, Kotlin cannot be contained in the brand name for your conference or educational event (such as KotlinConf or Kotlin Conference).  Instead, you should use your own brand name, but indicate that it is a conference for “Kotlin Language Users.”  Your conference or educational event title also should not cause any confusion or suggest any affiliation with or sponsorship by the Kotlin Foundation. Example of appropriate usages could be “XYZ Conference for Kotlin” with XYZ being your own brand name.  `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Other commercial or non-commercial names`}</strong>{`\nWhether you’re referring to a product, company or service, you shouldn’t incorporate Kotlin as your brand name, i.e. your company cannot be called “Kotlin Consulting” or “Kotlin IDE”. It can however indicate that you provide consulting for the Kotlin programming language as part of the description.  For example, XYZ Consulting, which focuses on the Kotlin programming language.  `}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
