Today, weâ€™re introducing the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program! This initiative will be held on a regular basis and provide financial awards to developers who contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem.

At the Kotlin Foundation, we understand the effort that goes into maintaining active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. We want to support these contributors, acknowledge their hard work, and encourage them to invest more time and energy into their projects and continue to make a difference. One of the program's essential aspects is that we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support. We believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work.

The Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will oversee the Grants Program. To be considered, projects must meet several requirements. First, the project must be available under a permissive open-source license. This ensures that the project remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Second, the project must be actively maintained and have a track record of development history and contributions. Finally, the project should be developed by private individuals. This means contributors are not allowed to develop their projects as part of their usual line of work.

We encourage you to submit your grant proposals before May 15, 2023. The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate projects based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices for library development, and responsiveness to bug reports and security issues.

Please reach out to us at [hello@kotlinfoundation.org](mailto:hello@kotlinfoundation.org) or through the [#kotlin-foundation](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/kotlin-foundation) Slack channel, where we'd be more than happy to address any of your program-related questions or concerns. We hope that the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program will provide contributors with the necessary support to continue their work, and we look forward to how you can shape the future of the Kotlin Multiplatform!
