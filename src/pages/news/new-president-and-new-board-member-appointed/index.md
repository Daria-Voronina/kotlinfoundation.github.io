With this transition, the Foundation looks forward to embracing new perspectives and reaching new milestones.

In addition to this announcement, the Kotlin Foundation would also like to extend its heartfelt gratitude to the former President, [Max Shafirov](https://twitter.com/mshafirov), for his exceptional contribution. Through Max’s strategic direction, the Kotlin Foundation has been able to foster an inclusive and vibrant community of developers, leading to extensive collaboration and continuous innovation within the Kotlin ecosystem.
