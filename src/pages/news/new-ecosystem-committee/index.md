The Kotlin Foundation has formed a new [Ecosystem Committee](/structure/), which we believe will be a key driver in helping the Kotlin ecosystem thrive.

The Ecosystem Committee will play a pivotal role in identifying strategic areas for investment in the Kotlin ecosystem. It will prioritize and recommend direct funding of open-source Kotlin projects and raise awareness of members’ individual efforts in developing and enhancing key libraries.

The Ecosystem Committee has already contributed to the Foundation’s work by designing and launching the new [Grants Program](/grants/), which supports authors of open-source libraries, tools, and frameworks. As the program supervisor, the committee will review grant applications, evaluate submitted projects, and decide whether each project meets the specific criteria for receiving the grant.

The new committee will serve as the research arm of the Kotlin Foundation board, assisting in maintaining the Kotlin ecosystem’s growth and sustainability. We are confident it will bring a fresh perspective and help us make informed decisions that will benefit the entire ecosystem.

We are excited to see the positive impact the Committee’s efforts will have on the Kotlin ecosystem in the near future.
