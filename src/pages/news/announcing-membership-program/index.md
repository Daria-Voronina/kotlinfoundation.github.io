Originally, the Kotlin Foundation’s mission was to preserve the Kotlin trademark, control incompatible changes to the language, and assign a lead language designer. But as of 2023, the Foundation is taking on more responsibility, which includes advancing the Kotlin ecosystem and promoting Kotlin in education.

At the Kotlin Foundation, we believe many companies that rely on the Kotlin ecosystem want to give back to the community and help the Foundation fulfill its mission. That’s why we are pleased to announce the Kotlin Foundation Membership Program for companies and organizations. The program allows you to become a part of Kotlin’s history and influence its ecosystem by contributing your work and ideas.

As a Kotlin Foundation member, you’ll support the Kotlin ecosystem by sponsoring projects that are important to the Kotlin community. Foundation members contribute to the board, committees, and workgroups helping shape the Foundation's funding distribution and overall strategy. Moreover, it’s an excellent opportunity to build a brand connection between the Kotlin community and your company.

The program offers different tiers to distinguish your business, so you can pick the one that works best for you and your needs: Gold or Silver.

**Gold membership**  is the perfect choice for companies and organizations looking to become active contributors to the Foundation's work, safeguarding the Foundation's financial and operational strength. Gold tier benefits include a guaranteed seat on the Foundation Board of Directors and the right to serve as Board Secretary.

**Silver membership** is designed for businesses and organizations that wish to get their name out there as big contributors to the Foundation. Silver members gain an opportunity to sit on the Foundation's board. For every 5 Silver members, you'll get 1 seat on the board. You’ll also be able to take part in the [Operating, Trademark, and Ecosystem Committees](https://kotlinfoundation.org/structure/).

Join other Foundation members to help us shape and develop the Kotlin ecosystem. If you want to apply or have any questions about the Kotlin Foundation and its membership program, you can drop us a line at [hello@kotlinfoundation.org](mailto:hello@kotlinfoundation.org). We’ll be happy to help!
