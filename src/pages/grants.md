# Grants

The Kotlin Foundation’s goal is to enhance the Kotlin ecosystem and facilitate its sustainable development. That’s why we're offering grants to support developers in creating and maintaining open source libraries, tools, and frameworks.

Prospective projects will be selected for grants based on their ability to meet the following criteria:
 * How well the project addresses a common problem in the Kotlin ecosystem, with a bias toward multiplatform solutions.
 * How effectively the project has been able to respond to security issues and bug reports, as well as Kotlin and library updates.
 * Whether or not the project adheres to the library development best practices.
 * Outlines a strategy for how the grant will be used to improve the project.

To submit your project, fill in the [application form](https://forms.gle/My2D81t9xEajURWu6). The first round of submissions closes May 15.

To be eligible, the project must comply with the requirements described in terms and conditions.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in #kotlin-foundation channel in the Kotlinlang Slack or email them to [hello@kotlinfoundation.org](mailto:hello@kotlinfoundation.org).
